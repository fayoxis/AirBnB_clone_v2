The project __AirBnB Clone - Web Framework(Web flask)__ is part of the curriculum at [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com//) and
it focuses on implementing a __web framework__ that handles `HTTP request and responses`,
`data storage`, and `user authentication`, among `other features`.
This __framework__ will serve as the backbone for building the __web application__.
The main goal of the project still remains to build a simplified version of the popular __AirBnB website__.


## Project Description :bust_in_silhouette::briefcase:

The __AirBnB Clone - Web Framework project__ involves several key components:

`Web Framework`: Implement a web framework from scratch that can handle HTTP requests and responses.
This framework will serve as the backbone for building the web application.

`User Authentication`: Develop a user authentication system to manage user registration,
login, and secure session handling.

`Data Storage`: Create a data storage engine that allows the application to store
and retrieve data related to users, places, bookings, and more.

`Frontend Development`: Design and develop the frontend of the application using HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript. This includes creating user interfaces,
displaying data, and enabling user interactions.

`API Endpoints`: Implement RESTful API endpoints to interact with the application programmatically.

`Testing`: Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure the functionality and
correctness of the web framework and application.
